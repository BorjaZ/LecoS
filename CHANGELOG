# Version 1.7.6


# Version 1.7.5
- SEXTANTE support!
- Fixed bug with the overlay calculation of landscape metrics (included no-data values)

# Version 1.7.4
- Fixed Bug with the rasterUnitsPerPixel extraction for QGIS 1.9/2.0. Now raises a warning if cells are not square
- Improved Input response

# Version 1.7.3
- Some Improvements with the mismatching shapes and extents -> now uses polygon extent instead of the whole shapefile
- Fixed Error with the Shannon Equitability
- Fixed Errors with Diversity indices and shapefile edits
- Fixed Bug causing QGIS to crash -> http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7612
- The Batchoverlay now displays the progress in the QGIS main window taskbar 

# Version 1.7.2
- Enabled the calculation of landscape statistics for vector layers
- Replaced QMessageBoxes with QMessageBar messages if a newer QGIS version (>= 10900) is used
- Removed the landscape diversity tool and merged options to calculate landscape diversity into the other toolset
- Fixed some small bugs with the GreatestPatch - SmallestPatch Metric
- Fixed some bugs with mismatching shapes and extents (maybe better solution in the future)

# Version 1.7.1
- Fixed the "Add Table to QGIS"-Bug on Windows systems
- Enables the option to save Results in the overlaying vectors attribute table

# Version 1.7
- Added new metrics: Median patch area, Mean patch distance, Mean patch perimeter, Mean patch shape ratio
- Fixed some small bugs with the landscape modifier
- Recreated the Batch-overlay tool from scratch and added several new functionalities to it
- Fixed a bug for Windows using old numpy / scipy version where the function "count_nonzero" was not available

# Version 1.6.1
- Implemented a check-routine for the landscape diversity module.
- Removed the icons from the toolbar as the functions increase. SEXTANTE support will be coming to enable easy access to LecoS
- Build hasattr and try-catch phrases around import modules
- Fixed small bug with the polygon-overlay

# Version 1.6
- Added the landscape modifier and several function to LecoS

# Version 1.5.1
- Implemented a small try-catch routine for gdal driver related issues

# Version 1.5
- Small Fixes. Implemented some error catching routines

# Version 1.4.9
- Fixed Errors resulting from the QGIS API Changes

# Version 1.4
- Added the options to calculate the median, upper and lower quantile, the minimum and the maximum as well
as the standard deviation from unclassified raster shapes in the polygon overlay tool

# Version 1.3
- Created the Polygon Landcover Overlay tool, which is capable of extracting values per polygon feature from 
underlying raster shapes. Both classified and non-classified raster shapes are supported. 

# Version 1.2
- Switched to a object orientied programming style. However parts of the code are still extremely slow :-(
- Added several new metrics including Total edge length, Edge Density, Landscape Division Index,
Splitting Index and Effective Mesh Size
- Fixed an Error with the Greatest Patch Size detection
- Added no-data field in the selection menu
- Removed Custom tab for now (maybe an implementation fill follow later if i have time)

# Version 1.1
- Moved Plugin completely to the raster toolbar
- Info Button moved to LecoS GUI
- Other Gui related things

# Version 1.0
First Release
