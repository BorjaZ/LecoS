	<h2>Euclidean Nearest-Neighbor Distance (ENN)</h2>
	ENN equals the distance (m) to the nearest neighboring patch of the same type, based on shortest edge-to-edge distance. 
	<br>
	Note that the edge-to-edge distances are from cell center to cell center.
	<br>
	ENN equals 0 if only one patch is present and has no upper limit. Units is defined by the projection so make sure you have a meter-based projection.
