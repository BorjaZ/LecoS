	<h2>Patch cohesion index</h2>
	Unitless index that measures the cohesion (physical connectedness) of a focal class.
	Approaches 0 as landscape becomes increasingly subdivided and less physically connected.
	<br>
	"Patch cohesion index measures the physical connectedness of the corresponding patch type. 
	Below the percolation threshold, patch cohesion is sensitive to the aggregation of the focal class. 
	Patch cohesion increases as the patch type becomes more clumped or aggregated in its distribution; hence, more physically connected."
